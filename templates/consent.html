		      <h3>Why is this research being done?</h3>
		      <p>The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between the design of a computer game and a player's engagement or skill development. We are interested not only in improving computer games, but in developing activities that are fun and also educational and engaging for a player.  Knowledge gained from this research could improve the design of educational software.</p>
		      <h3>How long will the research last?</h3>
		      <p>We expect that this research study will last for 2-3 years.</p>
		      <h3>How many people will be studied?</h3>
		      <p>We expect about 2000 people will be in this research study.</p>
		      <h3>What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?</h3>
		      <ul>
			  <li>You will be using your own computer to complete the study at a time of your choosing.</li>
			  <li>You will play a computer game that will last from between 2-20 minutes.</li>
			  <li>The game you will be asked to play is either an existing popular game, or a game we have developed in a similar vein to popular games. The game will require you to make a sequence of decisions based on the game state, depicted on the screen. Your choices will affect your score at the end of the game. Specific instructions will be provided.</li>
			  <li>What you see on the screen will be manipulated as part of the study.</li>
			  <li>We will record only your sequence of decisions and their timing, along with your worker ID. No personally identifiable information will be collected. </li>
		      </ul>
