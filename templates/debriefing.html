		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an

        <p>This study was aimed at trying to understand how people "discount" future rewards. In other words will you take a dollar now or wait a week to receive ten dollars. In this case we used waiting in a line.

		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
		research team member for this experiment: Brett Israelsen at brett.israelsen@colorado.edu.</p>
